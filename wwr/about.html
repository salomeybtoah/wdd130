        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Splash White Water Rafting was founded in 2025 by a group of adventure enthusiasts with the vision
            to
            share the joy and excitement of rafting adventures from all walks of life. What began as a small
            team of
            passionate river enthusiasts has grown into a trusted outdoor experience, offering safe, fun, and
            unforgettable trips on some of the most beautiful waterways. Our history is built on adventure,
            teamwork, and deep love for the river, and we're proud to continue creating stories and memories
            with
            ever splash. Our founders shared a love for the outdoors and a desire to share the
            joy of
            rafting with others. Over the years, we have expanded our offerings and now provide trips for
            all
